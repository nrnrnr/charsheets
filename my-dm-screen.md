I had been wondering why I had a hard time scouring the Internet for advice about what to put on my side of the DM screen.  Now that I have a couple of sessions under my belt, I realize that it's _very_ personal—as I get more experience, my own needs are sure to change.  Right now, almost everything is prepared by me and is customized to the composition of my party and the module I'm running.

In the spirit of _The Infinitive of Go_, in case it interests anyone, here's what's on my DM screen for my third session:

1. Summary of information about each player: name, pronouns, race, appearances, stat modifies, and proficiencies.  Plus relevant special information like darkvision or the name of their weapon

2. Passive perceptions of everyone in the party.

3. Damage types of each weapon or offensive spell, sorted by the player whose weapon or spell it is.

4. Damage resistances and vulnerabilities of each monster in the module.

5. Alphabetical list of all offensive spells in the party, showing which are attack rolls and which are saving throws (with stat for saving throw).

6. Alphabetical list of all durable spells in the party with the duration of each spell.

7. The conditions that might be applied during the module and what each does.

8. A large table, prepared by someone else, describing every D&D skill, with examples of using that skill for DCs of 5, 10, 15, and 20.

9. An oversize index card with the word BREATHE handwritten in large letters.
