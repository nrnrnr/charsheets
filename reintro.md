% Reintroducing your character

<article>

At the start of each session, I'd like you to reintroduce your character to the group.  Other members of the group will listen politely, but the real purpose is to remind *you* of your character so you can start getting into the right headspace for roleplaying.

Your introduction should be brief and should cover these five points:

1.  Obvious physical features
1.  Arms, armor, and clothing
1.  Symbols, insignias, decorations
1.  Unique distinguishing feature
1.  A fun fact from the last session

Some notes:

1. *Obvious physical features* means gender, race, build, ethnicity/features, and apparent age.  For nonhuman characters, quantify differences.

1.  *Arms, armor, and clothing* means every _visible_ weapon and _where it is carried_. Plus whatever armor and clothing are visible.

1.  *Symbols, insignias, decorations* that the characters wears---and if known, what they mean.

1.  A *unique distinguishing feature* could be physical, something worn, or even a mannerism.

1.  A *fun fact from the last session* means something _revealed during gameplay_ in the _most recent_ session.

A few examples follow.  Maybe you will recognize the source material.

> Lucy is a slender human woman just past puberty, with shining blond hair.  She wears no visible armor, only a forest-green tunic and a cream-colored cloak.  At her belt you see a small diamond flask and a plain dagger.  Lucy almost always seems wide-eyed and eager.
> In the last session we saw Lucy heal an injured badger; the diamond flask contains a magical healing cordial.

Here's an example where I have combined the distinguishing feature with the rest of the physical description:

> Miles is a short, slender human male. His slightly twisted frame stands under five feet, but with a head and neck that seem to belong to a much larger man.  His sharp gray eyes look out over a crisp, tailored white uniform that fits him perfectly. His chest displays the Dendarii Mercenaries’ starburst insignia gleams, and rank bars on his collar mark him as their commanding officer. At his hip, a compact plasma weapon sits in a holster.  In the last session we saw that he couldn't help propositioning a junior officer, even though she is in his chain of command.

And combining a symbol with the physical description:

> Paks is a tall, broad-shouldered woman in her late 20s.  Her bright yellow hair is wound up in a braid that should fit neatly in the metal helmet by her side.  She wears chain mail and leg armor, and in a sheath on her left hip she carries a longsword.  Her forehead is marked with the shining silver circle of the Great Lord, and her armor and weapons are always spotless, even unreasonably shiny.  In the last session we learned that she has no pretensions; despite outranking everybody except possibly King Kieri, she was more than willing to drop her other business to teach a new guard how to darn his sock.


Combining a symbol with armor:

> Alanna is a small, compact human woman with short, fiery red hair and violet eyes. She wears practical, battle-scarred plate armor, its breastplate engraved with a Lioness, which symbolizes her rank as the King’s Champion. A finely crafted sword hangs at her hip, its hilt wrapped in leather and marked with intricate runes, while a matching dagger is strapped to her thigh. Despite the heavy armor, she moves with a catlike grace.  In the last session we learned that she is not only a fighter; she used magic to create a barrier to protect herself and her companions.

And here's one where the unique distinguishing feature could be part of the
physical description, but I've written it separately.

> Sparrowhawk is a tall, stooped man of middle years.  His dark skin marks him as a native of Gont.  He is wearing a dark robe, and in one hand he carries a long staff---clearly a magician's tool, not a fighting weapon.  He also wears a small knife at his belt.  He bears no symbols or insignia.  His face would appear friendly, except it is horribly disfigured by a large scar that looks like claw marks.  In the last session we learned that he scan speak to dragons---and that dragons respect him enough to speak back.
