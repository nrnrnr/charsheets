  - Five bundles per stone

Stowed Weapons: 1 stone per 5 weapons

Empty containers count as miscellaneous equipment. Containers being used
to carry items don’t count towards encumbrance.

Larger sacks (often referred to as “loot sacks”) are also possible, but
these cannot generally be stored on the body. They must be carried in
both hands.

VARIANT – CREATURE WEIGHT BY SIZE

Your own weight does not count against your encumbrance, but these
figures are important for mounts. (They’ll also come in handy if you
need to carry a corpse or prisoner.)

  CREATURE SIZE   WEIGHT IN STONES
  --------------- ------------------
  Tiny            1 stone
  Small           2 stones
  Medium          12 stones
  Large           100 stones
  Huge            800 stones
  Gargantuan      6,400 stones

These figures are meant to serve as a useful rule of thumb, being
roughly accurate for creatures similar in build and type to humans (i.e.
fleshy humanoids). There will, however, be significant variance within
each size category. Even typical animals of Huge size, for example, can
easily range anywhere from 400 stones to 3,000 stones. Creatures of
unusual material can obviously shatter these assumptions entirely
(ranging from light-as-air ether cloud fairies to impossibly dense
neutronium golems).
