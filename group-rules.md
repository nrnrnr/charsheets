General Rules -The game is meant for everyone's mutual enjoyment, all participants should seek to entertain each other along with themselves. (Avoid splitting the party or ignoring each other)

-You can't join the table if you aren't able to regularly attend on time.

-No Player versus Player, no antagonizing each other, no stealing from each other. Any Character vs Character conflict desired by players must be approved by all participants for everyone’s entertainment.

-The DM produces the scenarios and the players decide how they want to respond to them. Some sidetracking is welcome, but players should expect to engage the content the DM prepares, otherwise players won't have prepared content, and the DM’s time is wasted.

-The DM doesn't create your characters or play them, players have agency over their character choices.

-Your characters aren't newbs who need to justify the features granted by character progression.

-Player characters are not blank slates ignorant of the world they grew up in, characters may know reasonable information their players do not.

-I don't utilize critical success or critical failure on a roll of 20 or 1 for skill checks or saves, nor fumble tables. There are scenarios where exceedingly high or low checks have an impact, but these are based on the totals rolled, not the die figure.

-”The rules don’t say I can’t” (TRDSIC) is not “rules as written” (RAW). The rules grant characters capabilities by inclusion, not omission.

-Roleplaying erotic behavior, graphic violence, and cultural discrimination should be avoided if anyone present is uncomfortable with witnessing it.

-The DM is not God, let's create together.
