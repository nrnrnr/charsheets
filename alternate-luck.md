I agree it would be tedious as a follow up to every check. But I would do it for important moments based on GM judgement like this:
Players get a luck score between 1-10.
After the player fails a check where I think luck applies, I roll 1d10 to check their luck before describing the outcome.
The luck check is a simple pass/fail. On a pass it overrules the failed check and I describe the outcome accordingly.

If I wanted bad luck to be a thing it would be easy enough to tweak that to accommodate it too.

I really hate "luck" mechanisms that simply change a die roll. If I'm modeling my player playing chess, I'm likely to use some sort of die roll, but for the character there's no luck involved at all. Conversely, the pirate captain turning out to be a childhood friend is a lucky break that could reasonably come up in a story (or a game), and no d20 roll will give that.

Treating a roll of 1 as a 20 (or whatever) is pretty comparable in effect to a +1 most of the time. If I told you your character was "lucky" and that the effect was a +1 to all die rolls, would you think that was a reasonable way to model extraordinary luck?

Luck should be far more about changing setting elements to favor the character or about something that CAN NOT come up on a simple 1d20 roll than a small die modifier. You can have a random element on when it comes up, but check once per scene or combat (one additional check if the character is killed), and if it comes up, apply something outside of a die modifier.
