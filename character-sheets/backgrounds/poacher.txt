Poacher
It’s illegal to hunt on lands owned by the nobility, with penalties ranging from dismemberment to death if you’re caught. But when the other choice is certain starvation for you and your family, that’s no choice at all. Not only did you learn to get away with poaching, but you also developed a taste for the thrill of the hunt.

Whether you were captured and escaped, nearly caught and forced to flee, or just wanted to move on to bigger things, you’ve now left behind a life of poaching for one of adventure, hunting bigger and even more dangerous prey.

Even though you left it all behind, the world of poaching still thrives. With a coded phrase, you can find out if and where illegal sales occur. Those handling the sales may provide you safe haven or information for the right price.
