 Next I'd like you to examine three files: hill-dwarf.txt,                  │
│   cleric-spec.txt, and war-spec.txt.  Each one contains character-creation   │
│   instructions in informal English.  I'd like you to translate each one      │
│   into a YAML file containing all the information needed to create the       │
│   character.  Use the keys in YAML.md.   Information like ability-score      │
│   increases should go as class features. Skill choices should be rendered    │
│   as "[Class] skill (list of choices)" in proficiencies.   Generally         │
│   anything you're unsure of is either a feature or a proficiency. Use your   │
│   judgment.
