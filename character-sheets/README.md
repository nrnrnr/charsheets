When I play D&D, I love the convenience of a paper character sheet.
Everything I need to know is right in front of me; there is no
mousing, clicking, tapping, or other fiddling with devices.
But when my character levels up or prepares new spells, 
updating a paper sheet is a nuisance, and so is copying out my character to a new sheet.
This project tries to provide the best of both worlds.
